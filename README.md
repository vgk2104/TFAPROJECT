# Project Description

Our Squirrel Tracker tracks all the known squirrels in Central Park. You can edit, add, view the squirrel data and see them on the map in the location they were found. This project uses data from 2018 Central Park Sq Census. 
Updating a squirrel can be reached from clicking the unique squirrel id inside List_Squirrel

You can reach out to us at sck2181@columbia.edu or vgk2104@columbia.edu to learn more about the project.
